This week, we used the concept of a Bag of Visual Words to generate the picture features in order to solve an image classification challenge. We looked at a basic machine learning pipeline and tried to make it better by adding more sophisticated features (Dense SIFT, Spatial Pyramid, Fisher Vectors), introducing preprocessing methods (Normalisation, scaling, and dimensionality reduction), and ultimately experimenting with various models (KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVMs with various kernels). Furthermore, we have run a number of hyperparameter searches using both na√Øve and optimum methods (Optuna).
